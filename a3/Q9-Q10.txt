Q9. Explain Encapsulation with an example. (Write at least 30-40 words).
	In encapsulation, we hide the data in a class from other by making all the data private,
	to make sure that the data cannot be accessed directly which is data hiding.
	And at the same time, we still have the power to control over the data.
	For example: 
	When we are going to log in our e-mail, the user donâ€™t have control over the email internal processing launched.
	we need to sign in with our user name and  password. 
	The password gonna be stored as a private data. 
	When we give them a correct password to meet the information stored in database, they give you access to your account.
	It helps to protect user privacy and the server privacy.

Q10. What is the difference between Encapsulation and Abstraction.
	1.  Level Different
		Encapsulation solves the problems at implementation level, but abstraction solves the problems at user level.

	2. Data Hiding
		Encapsulation means hiding data and cannot be access directly, and abstraction means hide some unwanted or unnecessary data. Also, abstraction focus on the result instead of how things work, but the encapsulation focus on how things work.

	3. Implementation
		Abstraction can be used in Interface and abstract class(outer), but the encapsulation used in terms of implementation(inner).
