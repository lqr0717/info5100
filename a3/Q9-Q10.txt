Q9. Explain Encapsulation with an example. (Write at least 30-40 words).
	In encapsulation, we hide the data in a class from other by making all the data private,
	to make sure that the data cannot be accessed directly which is data hiding.
	And at the same time, we still have the power to control over the data.
	For example: we set the all the data in course class to be private 
	to make sure other class even in the same package will not have the access to change the data stored in a course class.
	such as we have a new class defined by the following(outside the class Course):
	
	Class people{
	
		public static void main(String[] args) {
		Course c = new Course();
		c.setCourseId(233);
		}
	}
