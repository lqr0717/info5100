II. Write two differences between ArrayList and LinkedList. (Score 1)

  1. Implement difference: ArrayList implemented with the concept of dynamic array.
                           LinkedList implemented with the concept of doubly linked list.
                           
  2. Insertion difference: When we doing insertion with an arrayList, we need to consider resizing the array, shifting the rest of array,
                           updating  the index of the whole Arraylist, but for the LinkedList, it gonna be much easier.
